1.  Introduction

   Introduction here, please.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, BCP 14
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant CoAP
   implementations.

   In this document, the term "byte" is used in its now customary sense
   as a synonym for "octet".

2.  Problem Statement

   Since its early design days, the Internet has bypassed the session
   layer (i.e., layer 5 of the OSI model), in which the end-to-end
   context of communications among application processes is managed.
   That was a solid design decision, but it was based on the needs of
   envisioned applications and it took in account the then current
   structure of the Internet.  As the Internet evolved, the problem of
   tight coupling of the inter-process communications to underlying
   protocols was becoming evident, but it remained manageable chiefly
   through ad-hoc solutions.  The evolution of the Internet has been
   two-pronged and, following Vint Cerf's famous maxims, it could be
   summarized as "IP-on-everything," and "Everything-over-IP."  As far
   as "Everything-over-IP" development is concerned, the issues of
   communication persistence, re-start and check-pointing-as well as the
   client's ability to connect to multiple IP addresses in order to
   reach the same service-have been dealt with by applications
   themselves.  And the rich and ever-growing variety of the Internet
   applications has in turn demanded multiplicity of new application
   protocols to meet the demands of the Web access, media session
   control, real-time media sessions transport, messaging, etc.  To this
   end, even some application protocols that had been initially
   considered adequate for their respective tasks had to be replaced
   with the new protocols as the tasks were redefined.  Yet, all these
   protocols had to re-implement, time and again, an essentially
   invariant session layer abstraction, being further constrained by the
   underlying communication context and inherent dependence on the lower
   layers.  This dependence manifests itself most acutely when one
   considers its security implications.  Particularly from the end-to-
   end security point of view, this situation has posed a range of
   problems in the cases where:

   1.  A "wrong"' layer ends up being secured in that the wrong risks
       and liabilities are being addressed;

   2.  The application has to work across multiple and different
       transport layer protocols;

   3.  The security association (and hence the application) cannot
       survive the break-down in lower layers or an attack carried
       against them;

   4.  The process of establishing new security associations after a
       host failure is unacceptably slow to meet the demands of emerging
       environments (such as NFV and SDN) for high-availability; and

   5.  The underlying layer is not TCP or UDP or SCTP as is the case in
       Short-Messaging Services.

   The realization of the "IP-on-Everything" vision has brought yet
   another essential factor to consider: the highly-constrained data
   links.  The constraints are not only monetary: while cellular SMS is
   known for significant per-byte cost, other links (such as IEEE
   802.15.4k or 802.15.6) are energy-constrained.  This fairly new
   development has not been met by the existing security protocols,
   which were not designed to address the constraints here.  One danger-
   unfortunately often realized-is that security is intentionally turned
   off to reduce the expense.
   The good news is that none of the above problems is inherent to the
   Internet, and they can be successfully addressed by introducing-if
   only for the sake of security-the session layer and implementing a
   security protocol at that layer in the manner completely independent
   of the underlying context.  In particular, we demonstrate that such a
   session security protocol minimizes over-the-air-byte cost for
   highly-constrained networks while providing both the unicast and
   multicast support.
